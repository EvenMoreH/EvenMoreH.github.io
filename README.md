## Welcome to my "simple webpage" leading to my tool hub that contains a set of tools I have built while learning Python and FastHTML

### Currently my tool hub contains:
1. **Timer(alarm)** client with 4 separate instances for tracking multiple events (for example: baking multiple pies, cooking multiple dishes)
2. Simple **Temperature Converter** so you won't need to 'google' that everytime you need a conversion (for baking your pies of course!)

### Upcomming tools that will show up on the page:
- [ ] QR code generator
- [ ] Image(jpg/png) to .ico format converter (it will also cropp the image to square)
- [ ] Weight and volume converter
